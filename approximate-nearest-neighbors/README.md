# Approximate nearest neighbor search


The `approximate-nearest-neighbor.ipynb` notebook demonstrates using [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for multi-objective hyperparameter optimization on three approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms. To get started, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (also included as the first executable cell in the notebook), and run the notebook with your Jupyter environment of choice. 

Note that some of the ANN algorithms explored in this notebook take a considerable amount of time and memory at install. They also take a long time to train during hyperparameter optimization. We've provided estimates of cell run times within the notebook. While we encourage experimentation and exploration, we include saved results so that execution of each cell is not strictly required. 

The notebook was developed against Python 3.8.
