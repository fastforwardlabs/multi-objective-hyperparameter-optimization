# Approximate nearest neighbor search


The approximate-nearest-neighbor.ipynb notebook demonstrates using Optuna for multi-objective hyperparameter optimization on three approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms. To get started, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt (also included as the first executable cell in the notebook), and run the notebook with your jupyter environment of choice. The notebook was developed against Python 3.8.
